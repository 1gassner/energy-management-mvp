## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Pre-Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging environment
./deploy-scripts/deploy-backend.sh railway

# 2. Run smoke tests
npm run test:e2e:staging

# 3. Migrate frontends to staging
./migrate-frontends.sh

# 4. Verify all features work end-to-end
```

### Step 2: Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Deploy backend to production
export NODE_ENV=production
./deploy-scripts/deploy-backend.sh railway

# 2. Update frontend environment variables
./migrate-frontends.sh

# 3. Run immediate health checks
curl https://api.flowmind.app/health
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# 1. Run production tests
npm run test:e2e:production

# 2. Load test production
k6 run tests/load-testing/k6-load-test.js

# 3. Monitor for 24 hours
# Check monitoring dashboards every hour
```

## Monitoring & Alerting Setup

### âœ… Application Monitoring
- [ ] **Health Checks**
  - [ ] `/health` endpoint monitored every 30s
  - [ ] Database connectivity checked
  - [ ] External API availability verified

- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**
  - [ ] Response time tracking (< 100ms target)
  - [ ] Throughput monitoring (> 1000 req/min)
  - [ ] Error rate tracking (< 0.1% target)
  - [ ] WebSocket connection stability

### âœ… Infrastructure Monitoring
- [ ] **Server Resources**
  - [ ] CPU usage (< 70% average)
  - [ ] Memory usage (< 80% average)
  - [ ] Disk space (< 80% full)
  - [ ] Network bandwidth

- [ ] **Database Monitoring**
  - [ ] Connection pool status
  - [ ] Query performance
  - [ ] Storage usage
  - [ ] Backup verification

### âœ… Business Metrics
- [ ] **User Activity**
  - [ ] Active users per frontend
  - [ ] Authentication success rate
  - [ ] Feature usage tracking
  - [ ] Error occurrences by frontend

- [ ] **Performance KPIs**
  - [ ] 99.9% uptime SLA
  - [ ] < 100ms API response time
  - [ ] < 5s WebSocket connection time
  - [ ] Zero data loss guarantee

## Rollback Plan

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- [ ] Health check failures > 3 consecutive
- [ ] Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- [ ] Response time > 1s for 95th percentile
- [ ] WebSocket connection failures > 10%

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# 1. Immediate rollback
railway rollback --deployment previous

# 2. Revert frontend configurations
git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/.env.production

# 3. Verify rollback success
curl https://api.flowmind.app/health

# 4. Notify stakeholders
# Send status update via monitoring channels
```

## Post-Launch Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

### Hour 1-6: Critical Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor every 15 minutes
- [ ] Verify all endpoints responding
- [ ] Check error logs for anomalies
- [ ] Validate WebSocket stability
- [ ] Confirm frontend connections

### Hour 6-24: Standard Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor every hour
- [ ] Track performance trends
- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Analyze usage patterns
- [ ] Optimize based on real traffic

### Week 1: Optimization Phase
- [ ] Analyze performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize slow endpoints
- [ ] Scale resources if needed
- [ ] Implement improvements
- [ ] Plan next iteration

## Success Criteria
